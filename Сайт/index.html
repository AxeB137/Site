                <h1>Boby Axelrod</h1>
                <p> <img src="images.jpg" class="myImg"> Robert 'Bobby' Axelrod is the CEO of Axe Capital, a multibillion dollar hedge fund originally located in Connecticut before moving to New York City in Season 3. Known as "Axe" by friends and enemies alike, Bobby is an incredibly smart and capable investor, able to see many moves ahead in his investments and appearing to come out ahead every time. He is hardly ever on the losing side, and his intelligence, shrewdness, and decisive leadership often win him the awe and respect of friends and enemies. His intelligence and power also pull double to hide his nature as a ruthless and vindictive player that takes no prisoners, causing many to fear his wrath should they ever cross him.</p>
